## 👋 Hello, world

I'm a backend-focused developer currently transitioning from coffee industry into the tech world, actively building projects and working toward my first developer role. My journey began with C and C++ in school, followed by a 3-year diploma in Computer Science. In 2020, driven by my passion for networking, I earned the CCNA certification. In January 2025, I decided to return to tech, completed Harvard's CS50 Python course on edX, and have since been building backend-focused projects that showcase my technical foundation.
