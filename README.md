## Hi,

I'm a software developer currently transitioning from coffee industry to tech world. I'm actively building projects and working toward my first developer role. My journey began with C and C++ in school (2008), followed by a three-year diploma in Computer Science (2010-2013). In January 2025, I decided to transition to Software Development from Food and Beverage, completed Harvard's CS50 Python course on edX, and have been building projects ever since.
